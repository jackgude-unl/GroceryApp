# GroceryApp
Grocery Store App for CSCE 361

# SQL setup instructions
This creates a database called CSCE361 and its tables.
It also populates the tables with some dummy data.
Feel free to add your own.

*This script will drop all the tables and re-create them whenever it is run*

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio.
1. Don't change any settings, just click connect at the bottom left of the pop-up.
1. Copy "361 script.sql" from the GroceryApp Folder containing the solution.
1. Run the script in SQL Server Management Studio.

This should set up your local instance of the database.
You will need to keep SQL Server Management Studio running in the background whenever you are accessing the database.
